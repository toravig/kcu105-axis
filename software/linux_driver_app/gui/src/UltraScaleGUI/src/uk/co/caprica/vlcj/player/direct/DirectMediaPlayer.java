 * Specification for a media player that provides direct access to the video frame data.

 * Such a media player is useful for user interface toolkits that do not support the embedding of an
 * AWT Canvas, like JavaFX or an OpenGL toolkit like jMonkeyEngine.
 * <p>
 * A direct media player is also useful for applications that need access to the video frame data to

     * <p>
     * A corresponding call to {@link #unlock()} <strong>must</strong> always be made, no matter what
     * the return value from this method.

     * A client application must not interfere with the returned array - the returned array is the
     * "live" array used by the media player, so a client must not add/remove/re-order/etc the
     * returned array.
     * <p>
     * To mitigate this, a defensive copy of the array could have been returned, but this would be
     * added overhead (even though slight) that can be avoided.
